import java.sql package
	import java.sql.*;


STEP-02
Load and register driver
	Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
	Class.forName("org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver");

STEP-03
Create CONNECTION object
Connection is an interface and can't be instanciated.
To implement Connection interface, more 50 methods must be overrided.
The best possible way is to call the getConnection method from the DriverManager
class. The getConnection method is static, so it may be called by class name
reference.

	Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/database","root","root");

STEP-04
Create Statement Object:
There are three types of statements:
1. Statement
	These statements are compiled during the runtime and they are slow.
	Example:
		Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
		ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM student");
2. PreparedStatement
	These statments are compiled during compile time for which they are
	fast.
		PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM student");
								  conn.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO student VALUES(?,?,?)");
		//	Using placeholders
		pstmt.setString(1, "");
		pstmt.setString(2, "");
		pstmt.setString(3, "");
		pstmt.executeQuery();	pstmt.executeUpdate();
3. CallableStatement
	For executing DDL commands.
